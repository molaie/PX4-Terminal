# PX4-Terminal
After 2 years working on multi-rotors, and With FCs like Dual Sky and DJI Naza, it was time to using an open source one.
There is only one big & beauty Flight Controller in open source community.
it is PixHawk/PX4, Which one you like.
APM, is a bad choose, legacy arduino ide(is it really an IDE? :-) ), .pde file extensions(pain in ass) & Many many unbelievable dirty code.
they know that, so they start to choose PX4.
Mission Planner, as a planner for MAV's is another example of bad open source projects, that only works.
no one can contribute(for their bad non standard coding style), files are some here & some there.
QGroundControl, also is too buggy.
This project is an start to a new clean, simple, standard, developer likely Terminal.
I have no plan to support APM. Just PX4.
